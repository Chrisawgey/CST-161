-Loops and selection statemnet

print (x)
print (x)
print (x) 

what is a loop = repeating an action 

Executing a statemnt of given number of times

for i in range = a range of numbers is going to give you a list of numbers

range(10) you would repeat whatver number 10 times 

for i in range(10):             placeholder = i you can put anything it doesn't matter.
    print("example text")

    this would be example text ten times

for <variable> 

for i in range(4):
    print ( str(i) + " : ")
    print ("example")

The i would be a placeholder

for i in "this is a test":
    print (i)
    --------------------------------------

for i in range (1,12,5):
    print(i)

    this would go by (start,end, skip by) they could be expressions not just a number 

    you can always replace something from [a list] mutable

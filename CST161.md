Two of the most basic ones are:
-Algorithms
-Information processing 

Steps for subtracting two numbers :
-Step 1: write down the number, with larger number above smaller one, digits column-alligned from right 
-Step 2: start with the rightmost columns of digits and work your way left through the various columns
-step 3: Write down difference between the digits and work yoour way left through the various columns
-step 4: if there is no next colums to the left, stop
        -Otherwise, move to column to the left; go to step3



ex: d = 4 (operator) - 2 --> operand

Get the number 4
get the second number 2
perform opertaion 4-2 
print 

simple instructions to perform the tasks 

Flaw of logic to be able to perform this operation.

Acceleration = velocity
               _______
                Time
input velocity, time 
divide velocity by time 
store value of 2
Print dipslay output 


(source file)

a=input ("Enter a number")
b= input("another number")
d= a/b
print+(d)

byte code is when you intepret you file like py and its going to get a machine code in other languages they
they dont call it byte code

exe= executer

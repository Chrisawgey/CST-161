Width                       Ram:
Height                      width|:5    
Area                        height|:7 <------ numbers are integers and float are not the same
                                               all integers are 2mb and strings are 4mb
                             area|:35
                                35.3 is 8mb
                            areal=width*width

                            5*3 would be a float
